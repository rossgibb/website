  <h1>2013 CSAW Final write-up &mdash; Silk Street</h1>
  <p>The following is a solution writeup to the "Silk Street" problem from the 2013 CSAW Final.</p>
  <p>This write-up is structured as a tutorial demonstrating how to begin analyzing the Silk Street binary,
     how to identify the vulnerabilities, and goes through
     various revisions and refinement of the exploit code to fix bugs until the exploit code works.
     However, it is assumed you have working knowledge of
     reverse engineering and IDA (free version is fine), linux, wireshark, and gdb. It also assumes you understand how
     <a href="http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html">stack based buffer overflows</a>
     can be exploited. The writeup goes into a decent amount of detail about format
     string vulnerabilities, and demonstrates the use of one, as I have found other write-ups lacking thorough
     explanations around the exploitation of format string vulnerabilities.</p>
  <p>At time of writing, you can <a href='https://isisblogs.poly.edu/2013/12/02/csaw-ctf-finals-2013-vms/'>
     download a VM image</a> that contains the CSAW 2013 Finals challenges running live, so you can solve them and get
     the actual flag from a remote system. I highly recommend doing this, nothing is as satisfying as gaining remote code
     execution on an actual remote system.</p>
  <p>I have included the Silk Street binary here in case the VM image is no longer available. You can run and exploit the binary locally
     if CSAW Final VM is not available.</p>

  <h3>Silk Street - by Jeff Crowell</h3>
  <p>After silkroad got shut down, some competitors popped up. This clone isn't even running over TOR... can you pop a shell and read
     the flag?</p>

  <p>From the problem description it sounds like this will be an exploitation challenge, so there's a good chance this will involve
     some memory corruption and shellcode.</p>
  <p>Using <span class='code'>file</span> on the binary tells us it is a 32-bit non-stripped ELF file. Now is a good time
     to interact with program a little bit to see how it works, which means we just run it and see what happens.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_1.png"/>
  <p>As you can see the program implements a black market, from which I bought some LSD using bitcoins.</p>
  <p>It's also always a good idea to mess around with program inputs before your start reverse engineering, you never
     know what will pop up. If we do this with <span class='code'>printf</span> format string parameters you will notice
     some strange output.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_2.png"/>
  <p>Above you can see <span class='code'>%d%d</span> being entered as an input command. The program echoes back an error
     message, but previous to the message are some numbers being printed. Looks like we've found a format string vulnerability.
  <p>Let's track down the format string vulnerability. We'll use IDA for this.</p>
  <p>The format string vulnerability can be found in the main function (<span class='code'>VA 0x08048e0c</span>) at the
     <span class='code'>printf</span> call at <span class='code'>VA 0x08048f9f</span></p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_3.png"/>
  <p>The vulnerability comes about because the user input is passed directly to the <span class='code'>printf</span> function
     and the user input acts as the format string to the <span class='code'>printf</span> function. In theory, a format string
     vulnerability lets us read and write arbitrary memory. However in practice, format string vulnerabilities are not always
     so flexible. In the case of this one, the buffer our input is read into (labeled as <span class='code'>input_buf_0x8</span>)
     is safely limited to 8 characters, which could limit what we are able to do with the vulnerability.</p>
  <p>The format string vulnerability could be enough in itself to achieve remote code execution, but often a format string
     vulnerability itself is not enough. If we glance around the main function a little bit more we see a call to
     <a class='code' href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/gets">gets</a> at <span class='code'>VA 0x08049044</span>.
     Calls to <span class='code'>gets</span>
     are extremely dangerous as they don't check the number of bytes read. The <span class='code'>gets</span> call here is
     used to read our response when the program asks if we plan to do anything illegal with our silkstreet purchase. The
     program expects us to send one character, but if we send a bunch we can overwrite the return address on the stack
     and crash the program.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_4.png"/>
  <p>It's a good idea to test our hypothesis by running the program locally, buying something, selecting to checkout
     our purchase, and when it asks us if we plan to do anything illegal we will send it a large buffer and see if we
     can get the program to crash.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_5.png"/>
  <p>The above demonstrates the program crash. You will notice that the main function finishes without problem by
     printing out the apology, but when the main function attempts to return to the operating system a segmentation
     fault occurs because we overwrote the return address on the stack with nonsense.</p>
  <p>This buffer overflow could potentially let us execute shellcode directly on the stack, but the stack has to be
     executable. We can check if the stack is executable or not by running <span class='code'>readelf -l silkstreet</span>.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_6.png"/>
  <p>Turns out it's not executable&mdash;as indicated by RW&mdash;so we are not going to be able to just write
     shellcode on the stack and execute it. Since we can overwrite the return address we could return into glibc or
     attempt to use ROP gadgets to execute arbitrary code. However, the silkstreet process we actually want to
     exploit is running remotely, and we don't have a copy of the actual glibc library that the remote instance
     of silkstreet is using. Without a an exact copy of the remote program's glibc library performing a return to
     glibc attack or using ROP gadgets in that library is going to be challenging. Since we can read arbitrary
     memory with our format string vulnerability perhaps we could map out memory and figure out a glibc/ROP attack,
     but that still sounds pretty hard. Since we have only looked at the main function of silkstreet so far,
     we should keep looking to determine if there are other points in the binary that can be used to our advantage.</p>
  <p>While we look through the binary its a good opportunity to review what we have, and what we could potentially use,
     so we know what to look for.</p>
  <p>What we have:</p>
  <ul><li>A format string vulnerability – good for reading memory, leaking memory addresses, and writing to memory</li>
      <li>A buffer overflow vulnerability – we can write to stack memory and control program execution flow using this</li></ul>
  <p>What we need:</p>
  <ul><li>Some executable memory that we can write to – we could load shell code there to execute
      <li>The memory address of executable memory where our shellcode is – this is where we would send program execution
          using our buffer overflow</li></ul>
  <p>Let's work on finding some executable memory we can write to. If we refer back to the <span class='code'>readelf</span>
     output we can see that there are no sections of the program that are both executable and writable.
     Our other option is to find heap memory the program allocates that is both writable and executable.</p>
  <p>If we look at the function called <span class='code'>_Z9getVictimP4User</span> at <span class='code'>VA 0x08049249</span>
     we see a call to <span class='code'>posix_memalign</span> at <span class='code'>VA 0x0804926e</span>. Looking up the
     documentation on
     <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Aligned-Memory-Blocks.html#index-posix_005fmemalign" class='code'>
     posix_memalign</a> we learn that <span class='code'>posix_memalign</span> allocates memory
     aligned to a multiple of a value chosen by the programmer. In the case of silkstreet, the memory allocated by
     <span class='code'>posix_memalign</span> will be the size of the system's memory page size (notice the system's
     page size is looked up using a call to <span class='code'>getpagesize</span> just before <span class='code'>posix_align</span>).
     In this case the returned memory address from <span class='code'>posix_memalign</span> will be exactly one memory page in
     size and the address of that memory will be aligned to a multiple of the page size. We aren't told what the remote
     system's page size is, but the default size of a Linux system is 4Kb, more than enough for useful shellcode. Also
     of extreme importance is the call to <span class='code'>mprotect</span> at <span class='code'>VA 0x08049288</span>
     where it sets the permissions to this newly allocated memory to RWX, we have found executable memory that is also writable.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_7.png"/>
  <p>Great, we have executable memory that we believe is large enough to put useful shellcode in. But can we write arbitrary
     data to this memory?</p>
  <p>It turns out we can. To determine this we first have to figure out the program flow to get the program to call the
     <span class='code'>_Z9getVictimP4User</span> function. It should be easy to see that this function is called when the
     user of the program decides to purchase an assassination. At checkout time if an assassination has been purchased the
     program determines who the user desires to be assassinated. The memory allocation we noted above is used to hold any
     “special instructions” the user needs to provide for the assassination.</p>
  <p>Looking at the program location where the special instructions are read from the user we see a call to
     <span class='code'>fgets</span> to read the input from the user. The size of data read is <span class='code'>0x2710</span>
     bytes and there is no
     additional processing on the data read in, so we can send whatever data we want to the executable memory, including
     shellcode. Of equal importance, the memory is not freed at the end of the function so it will be available elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Now we have executable memory that we can write anything we want to, and we have a buffer overflow to direct
     program execution to this executable memory. Using these facts we can formulate an exploitation plan.</p>
  <p>Plan:</p>
  <ol><li>Purchase an assassination from silkstreet</li>
      <li>When asked for 'special instructions' for the assassination provide shellcode
      <li>When asked if we are going to do anything illegal with our purchase send enough data to overwrite the return
          address from the main function directing execution to the shellcode.</li></ol>
  <p>It's a good plan, but we are missing a critical piece, what memory address will the shellcode exist at? We need to know
     this in order to overwrite the main function's return address with the address of where the shellcode exists. The
     address of the memory allocated by <span class='code'>posix_memalign</span> will vary from execution to execution. Guessing
     the memory address of the shellcode is not a very elegant solution and is likely not to work anyway. Our best bet is to
     find a way to leak the memory address of the shellcode. We have a format string vulnerability that can be used to read
     memory, maybe we can use this to leak the address of the allocated memory.</p>
  <p>There are likely multiple ways to leak the memory address of the shellcode, but one way is to remember that the
     memory was allocated using <span class='code'>posix_memalign</span> and aligned to a multiple of the system's page size.
     If we think about how the memory allocator is likely to work in this scenario we can see a possible solution. Let's say
     the last memory the memory allocator allocated was at address <span class='code'>0x03304500</span> and was
     <span class='code'>0x100</span> bytes in size. The memory allocator will know that the next available memory is at address
     <span class='code'>0x03304600</span>, the address immediately after the memory just allocated.
     When the memory allocator gets the next request from silkstreet using the <span class='code'>posix_memalign</span> function
     requesting to allocate 4Kb of memory at a memory address that is a multiple of 4Kb, the
     memory allocator can't use the next available memory address of <span class='code'>0x03304600</span>. This is because that address
     is not a multiple of 4K. What address will the memory allocator allocate to? Without looking at the source code of the memory
     allocator it's hard to know for sure, but a good guess is that the memory allocator will allocate the memory at the next
     available address that is a multiple of 4K. In this case that address will be at <span class='code'>0x03305000</span>
     (recall 4Kb is equal to <span class='code'>0x1000</span>). It is important to remember that if this assumption holds,
     then we don't have to leak the exact address of shellcode, we just have to leak a memory address that was allocated before
     the memory for the shellcode was allocated. We will then assume the shellcode is at the next memory address that is a
     multiple of 4Kb, and calculate that address.</p>
  <p>So our goal is to leak the memory address of either the shellcode itself, or an address of any memory allocated before the
     memory for our shellcode was allocated.</p>
  <p>We plan to use the format string vulnerability so it's a good time to remember how to use format string vulnerabilities
     to read arbitrary memory. This is very good tutorial on <a href="http://althing.cs.dartmouth.edu/local/formats-teso.html">
     using format string vulnerabilities</a>. For our case we are going to utilize the <span class='code'>%n$</span>
     construct to read arbitrary stack memory.</p>
  <p>Recall that if we want to print out an integer as a hex value using <span class='code'>printf</span>
     we would use the format string <span class='code'>'%x'</span>. When
     <span class='code'>printf</span> is called it will read the format string of <span class='code'>'%x'</span> from the stack
     and expect to find the value to print as the next argument on the stack. For example if we try and print out the
     unsigned decimal value of 3735928559 using <span class='code'>printf('%x', 3735928559)</span> the stack should look like this.</p>

  <p>When <span class='code'>printf</span> is called it will find the address of the format string as the first argument on the
     stack. From the format string it will determine that a hexadecimal number should be printed out, and it will look for that
     number as the second argument on the stack. The result will be <span class='code'>printf</span> printing out
     <span class='code'>'deadbeef'</span>,  the hex value of <span class='code'>3735928559</span>.
  <p>The <span class='code'>printf</span> function takes a variable number of arguments that are normally in order on the stack.
     There is a feature of the format string that allows the arguments to be retrieved in arbitrary order using the
     <span class='code'>%n$</span> notation. For example if we specify the format string as <span class='code'>%3$x</span> it
     indicates we want to read and print the third argument passed to <span class='code'>printf</span>. If we only pass one
     argument we will read values from the stack that we didn't put there. For example, using
     <span class='code'>printf('%3$x', 3735928559)</span> the stack will look as follows.</p>

  <p>The value printed by <span class='code'>printf</span> in this case will be whatever is on the stack 2 stack pushes up
     from the one argument we did pass to <span class='code'>printf</span>. When you control the format string you can print
     arbitrary stack memory addresses.</p>
  <p>Going back to the weak <span class='code'>printf</span> statement in silkstreet, we need to take a close look at the stack of
     the function in order to find a stack location that
     contains an address of allocated heap memory. We can then use the <span class='code'>printf</span> function to leak this
     data giving us an address on the heap.</p>
  <p>To do this we basically map out the stack looking for a stack address that contains a heap allocated address. It is relatively
     easy to see what data is being put on the stack using IDA. At <span class='code'>VA 0x08048f04</span> we have a call to
     <span class='code'>_Znaj</span>, some googling tells us this is a mangled name for the new operator in C++, which would
     be allocating heap memory. The memory address returned by <span class='code'>_Znaj</span> is placed on the stack immediately
     after this call, and if it's on the stack we should have access to it using our <span class='code'>printf</span> vulnerability.</p>
  <p>It's useful to diagram the stack to see what we need to try and print. This stack diagram is when program execution
     is at the weak <span class='code'>printf</span>
     function at <span class='code'>VA 0x08048f9f</span>.

  <p>Using the stack diagram we can calculate what the value of the <span class='code'>printf</span> format string should be.
     The value of n will be the positive offset from <span class='code'>%esp</span> that we want to print divided by 4 to count
     the number stack positions up we need <span class='code'>printf</span> to look. For our stack it will be
     <span class='code'>0x58 / 0x4 = 0x16 = 22</span>. Therefore, our format string should be <span class='code'>'%22$x'</span>.</p>
  <p>We can give this a shot to determine if what is printed out is a reasonable stack address.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_8.png"/>
  <p>The value <span class='code'>0x931a008</span> could be a stack address, but we can do some more testing to be sure.</p>
  <p>Recall that our hypothesis is that the memory address of where the purchased assassination's special instructions is stored will
     be the next higher memory address at a 4K boundary than a previously allocated memory address. In the example above the
     allocated heap memory address is <span class='code'>0x931a008</span>, so we expect the 'special instructions' memory to be allocated
     at <span class='code'>0x931b000</span>, which is the next higher memory address divisible by 4Kb (recall
     <span class='code'>4Kb = 4 x 1024 = 4096 = 0x1000</span>).
  <p>This is our working hypothesis, what we now need to do is test our hypothesis by beginning to write our exploit. To test
     our hypothesis we will use a debugger.</p>
  <p>To test our hypothesis we are going to put a breakpoint right after the allocation of the memory used to hold the
     assassination's 'special instructions'. First, we must purchase an assassination, then leak the memory address of
     the allocated heap memory using our format string vulnerability. Next, we will calculate the address by hand that we think the
     'special instructions' memory will be allocated at, and finally, use the debugger to check if our
     calculation provides the actual memory address of the 'special instructions'.</p>
  <p>Using gdb, begin by placing a breakpoint at <span class='code'>0x08049279</span> which is after the call to
     <span class='code'>posix_memalign</span>, the address returned by <span class='code'>posix_memalign</span> will be placed in
     <span class='code'>%eax</span>.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_9.png"/>
  <p>Purchase an assassination and then enter <span class='code'>'%22$x'</span> to trigger the format string vulnerability.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_10.png"/>
  <p>The leaked address printed is <span class='code'>0x804c008</span>, so if do our calculation, the next memory address at a 4Kb
     boundary will be <span class='code'>0x804d000</span>. This is where we are expecting the value of the 'special
     instructions' memory to be. Now, select checkout and promise not to do anything illegal
     with our purchases. When the breakpoint we previously placed is hit display the registers and see if the value of
     <span class='code'>%eax</span> matches what we calculated above.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_11.png"/>
  <p>Success! Looks like our reasoning was correct. We can use our format string vulnerability to leak a memory address,
     using that memory address we can calculate the address of the executable memory that we are going to place our shellcode into.
     Finally, we will use our buffer overflow to direct execution to our shellcode and we will have achieved remote code execution.</p>
  <p>Here's our exploitation plan:</p>
  <ol><li>Purchase an assassination</li>
      <li>Use the format string vulnerability to leak a heap memory address. Using this memory address calculate the
          location of our shellcode</li>
      <li>Choose to checkout our purchase</li>
      <li>When asked to agree not to do anything illegal with our purchase, enter 'y', followed by a null byte,
          followed by enough data to fill up the stack to the return address, and then write the memory address of our shellcode, so
          our shellcode becomes the return address of the function</li>
      <li>As part of checkout we will be asked if there are any 'special instructions' for our assassination, here is where we will
          supply our shellcode</li>
      <li>We will have achieved remote code execution when we return from the main function to our shellcode</li></ol>
  <p>Since we want a remote shell, shellcode that implements a reverse remote shell should do, we can simply use shell code
     already written from <a href='http://shell-storm.org/shellcode'>shell-storm.org/shellcode</a>, this one <a
     href='http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-849.php'>implements a reverse shell</a> and should work fine.</p>
  <p>We do need to interact with the program over the network, so we are going to test our exploit by running silksteet locally,
     and communicating with it through a local socket, as if it were running remotely. We can do this by first creating a named pipe
     and then have <span class='code'>netcat</span> send input to, and read output from, silkstreet using the named pipe.
     We also want to enable core dumps so
     that we can examine the programs memory if it crashes as we develop our exploit. Use the following commands to enable
     core dumps, create the named pipe, and execute silkstreet using <span class='code'>netcat</span> and the named pipe.
     The <span class='code'>stdbuf</span> command ensures that IO is not buffered.</p>
<pre>
$ ulimit -c unlimited
$ mkfifo silky
$ nc -l 127.0.0.1 4444 < silky | stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 ./silkstreet > silky
</pre>
  <p>After the above command is run you should be able to connect to 127.0.0.1 on port 4444 using <span class='code'>netcat</span>
     and interact with the program as normal.</p>
<pre>$ nc 127.0.0.1 4444</pre>
  <p>The last calculation we need to make is how many bytes we need to send to overflow the stack and replace the return address.
     Again, we will use a stack diagram to help us determine it.</p>

  <p>The offsets to the left are based on the offsets provided by IDA. It can be a little confusing when working with negative
     offsets, but basically we need to remember the buffer actually starts at offset <span class='code'>-0x57</span>, so to fill
     up offsets <span class='code'>-0x57</span> to <span class='code'>0x0</span> we need to send <span class='code'>0x58</span>
     bytes. This overwrites up to the stored value of <span class='code'>%ebp</span>, we send another <span class='code'>0x4</span>
     bytes to overwrite that value. Therefore, we first send a total of <span class='code'>0x5c</span> bytes to overwrite up to the
     return address, then we can send the
     address of out shell code to ensure our shell code get executed when we return from this function.</p>
  <p>Using all the information we have gathered,
     <a href="https://github.com/rossgibb/ctf/blob/master/2013_csaw_finals/silkstreet/exploit_1.py">
     this is the exploit code we come up with</a>.</p>
  <p>Now it's time to test our exploit on the silkstreet running on the local socket. It is important to remember to open up a
     <span class='code'>netcat</span> instance listening on local port 31337. This is the port we configured the reverse-shell
     shellcode to connect back to. Open the listening socket as follows:</p>
  <pre>$ nc -k -l 31337</pre>
  <p>Now we're ready to test our exploit.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_12.png"/>
  <p>From the output of our exploit code it appears to have worked. We can check the window where we launched silkstreet
     to make sure it is still running, which it should be if our reverse shell connected. Unfortunately, we can see that
     it has crashed.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_13.png"/>
  <p>Since we enabled core dumps we can load the core dump in gdb.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_14.png"/>
  <p>Apparently the program crashed at <span class='code'>VA 0x08049341</span>, we now need to go back to IDA to see what
     the program is doing at this point.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_15.png"/>
  <p>The crash occurs at the second call to <span class='code'>mov eax,[eax]</span> marked in the disassembly above.
     The <span class='code'>eax</span> register must contain an invalid memory address. Using gdb we can see what is in
     <span class='code'>eax</span> at this point.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_16.png"/>
  <p>Clearly <span class='code'>eax</span> contains part of our stack overflow data as the value <span class='code'>0x77</span>
     was what we overwrote the stack with up to the return address. Some of the stack data we overwrote must have been
     important. We need to go back to the binary and see if we can adjust our overflow to not crash the program.</p>
  <p>From reverse engineering we find that the function <span class='code'>_ZN4UserC2Ev</span> at
     <span class='code'>VA 0x08049418</span> is what is responsible for setting the memory that <span class='code'>eax</span>
     is supposed to refer to when the crash occurs. We can see that at <span class='code'>VA 0x0804941e</span> the value
     <span class='code'>0x0804a3d0</span> is placed in the memory address passed in as the first argument. The value
     <span class='code'>0x0804a3d0</span> is actually the VA of the function <span class='code'>_ZN4User8orderHitEPKc</span>,
     so this is what actually needs to be in <span class='code'>eax</span> when we observed the crash. Again from reverse
     engineering we can see that the argument to <span class='code'>_ZN4UserC2Ev</span> is a memory address on the stack in
     the main function at offset <span class='code'>-0x14</span>. We must preserve this value on the stack
     for the program to properly reach our shell code.</p>
  <p>At this point it becomes obvious we don't actually need to overwrite the return address of the main function, we could
     simply overwrite the function pointer to <span class='code'>_ZN4User8orderHitEPKc</span> on the stack with the address
     of our shellcode. However, we are going to stick to out plan and  continue to attempt to overwrite the return address
     of the main function
     using the buffer flow. Crafting an exploit that overwrites the function pointer to <span class='code'>_ZN4User8orderHitEPKc</span>
     on the stack is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
  <p>Here's an updated stack diagram of the main function where we are exploiting the buffer overflow.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, all we need to do is adjust our overflow slightly to preserve the value <span class='code'>0x0804a3d0</span>
     on the stack. The updated
     <a href="https://github.com/rossgibb/ctf/blob/master/2013_csaw_finals/silkstreet/exploit_2.py">
     exploit code is here</a>.</p>
  <p>Once we have made that small change we run the new exploit. The exploit again appears to work, but this time silkstreet
     doesn't crash, and we try our listening netcat instance and we have a shell!</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_17.png"/>
  <p>Awesome! We are almost there, we have successfully exploited the program locally over a socket, now all we need to do is
     exploit the actual remote service.</p>
  <p>The next step it to cross your fingers and run the exploit against the actual CSAW Finals VM image.</p>
  <p>In this case the exploit fails to trigger. It's not uncommon for an exploit not to work immediately when attempting to
     exploit a remote service, even if it was working locally. The best way to debug this is to print out any and all output
     send back from the remote service.</p>
  <p>When we print out the output received from the server we notice that our commands are echoed back at us. This causes a
     problem because when we go to read the leaked memory address more data came back than expected. We can easily fix this
     and try again.</p>
  <p>When we try again taking in to account out input being echoed back, we can read the correct address this time, but our
     exploit again fails to trigger.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_18.png"/>
  <p>In the above we can see that we are correctly interacting with the program, but our exploit is still not triggering,
     evidenced by our listening socket not receiving a connection from the reverse shell.</p>
  <p>Since our input is being echoed back at us it might be a good idea to check if what we are sending is what we are getting
     sent back. It is a little difficult to see this in the terminal, but we can use wireshark to see the raw bytes.</p>
  <img src="img/silkstreet_19.png"/>
  <p>Viewing the TCP stream between our exploit script and the remote machine we can see even in the ASCII view that data
     is coming back different than what we sent.</p>
  <p>Looking at the hex output, it looks like certain bytes are being replaced with other bytes. This part can be tricky to solve.
     Doing a systematic examination of what bytes are altered it starts to be obvious that only low bytes, bytes
     below <span class='code'>0x20</span>, are being altered. We know from the ASCII table that low value bytes have special
     meaning, so its a good guess that the low bytes we sending are getting altered or escaped by something
     before they get to the program.</p>
  <p>To get past problems like this Google and perseverance are usually what it takes. Staring at the wireshark output some
     more and looking at exactly what is coming back we notice that when a <span class='code'>0x0</span> byte is sent we actually
     get two bytes back in its place <span class='code'>0x5e40</span>, or <span class='code'>'^@'</span>. The trick is realizing
     that <span class='code'>'^@'</span> is the ASCII escape sequence for <span class='code'>0x0</span>. Here's a table that
     shows some of the ASCII escape sequences:</p>
<pre>#define NUL             0x00    /* ^@ - Null */
#define SOH             0x01    /* ^A - Start of Header */
#define STX             0x02    /* ^B - Start of Text */
#define ETX             0x03    /* ^C - End of Text */
#define EOT             0x04    /* ^D - End of Transmission */
#define ENQ             0x05    /* ^E - Enquiry */
#define ACK             0x06    /* ^F - Acknowledgement */
#define BEL             0x07    /* ^G - Bell */
#define BS              0x08    /* ^H - Backspace */
#define HT              0x09    /* ^I - Horizontal Tab */
#define LF              0x0A    /* ^J - Line Feed */
#define VT              0x0B    /* ^K - Vertical Tab */</pre>
  <p>What appears to be happening is that something is interpreting the low bytes as ASCII control codes and escaping them.
     How can we stop this?</p>
  <p>Again, more Google, and specifically this <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=44882">post</a> gives us
     a hint it might have to do with the value <span class='code'>0x16</span>. It appears that we might be able to bypass the ASCII
     escaping if we prepend each control code byte with the value <span class='code'>0x16</span>. Meaning if we want to send
     <span class='code'>0x0</span> we need to actually send <span class='code'>0x16</span> then <span class='code'>0x0</span>.</p>
  <p>The script needs to be modified to escape the ASCII control codes. One thing to keep in mind is we don't want to escape
     <span class='code'>0xa</span> (newline) or <span class='code'>0xd</span> (carriage return) because we want these to be
     interpreted as their control values.</p>
  <p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/rossgibb/ctf/blob/master/2013_csaw_finals/silkstreet/exploit_final.py">
     updated exploit code</a> that escapes ASCII control codes we need to.</p>
  <p>Once we make our script changes we try again. This time, success! We have a remote shell in our <span class='code'>netcat</span>
     listening window and all we need to do is find the key and print it out.	</p>
