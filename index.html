  <p class='command'>What's with the look of the site?</p>
  <p>There was an early port of the GNU programming tool set (gcc, et al.) to the x86 architecture called DJGPP, written by
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Delorie">DJ Delorie</a>. DJGPP is a 
     beautifully designed programming environment. In circa 2014 when I was thinking of a design for this page
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_UI_Design">flat design</a> was all the rage, gradients having just been found to be totally
     un-hip. Of course I wanted to be at the cutting edge of computer user interface design, so I chose to produce an
     <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=djgpp&tbm=isch'>homage to DJGPP circa 1993</a>. It seems
     computer user interface design, like fashion, is cyclical.</p>
  <p>I would encourage any computer science students to check out
     <a href='http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/'>DJGPP</a> if you are inclined to want to experience what old people often refer to as
     the "good ol' days".</p>

     I last updated it feel free to send me an email.</p>

  <p>I like participating in capture the flag competitions and here are some write-ups from some competitions I have participated in.</p>
  <p>Anything marked with a '*' is a detailed write-up. Write-ups lacking a '*' are likely
     just pure solutions. Feel free to do whatever you want with code and information in the write-ups.</p>
