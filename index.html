  <p>The best way to contact me is via email. I tire quickly of social media, so if you managed to dig up an account on some service
     that looks to be mine there's a good chance I never saw messages sent there.</p>
  <p>rg&#64;<!-- &#64 stuff fake@email.com -->rossgibb<!-- more fake@doman.com 
       

                                                    -->.ca</p>
  <p>This email forwards to whatever email address I happen to be using at the time. If you have another email address for me that
     I don't seem to be responding from try this one.</p>
  <p class='command'>What's with the look of the site?</p>
  <p>There was an early port of the GNU programming tool set (gcc, et al.) to the x86 architecture called DJGPP, written by
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Delorie">DJ Delorie</a>. DJGPP is a 
     beautifully designed programming environment. In circa 2014 when I was thinking of a design for this page
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_UI_Design">flat design</a> was all the rage, gradients having just been found to be totally
     un-hip. Of course I wanted to be at the cutting edge of computer user interface design, so I chose to produce an
     <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=djgpp&tbm=isch'>homage to DJGPP circa 1993</a>. It seems
     computer user interface design, like fashion, is cyclical.</p>
  <p>I would encourage any computer science students to check out
     <a href='http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/'>DJGPP</a> if you are inclined to want to experience what old people often refer to as
     the "good ol' days".</p>

     I last updated it feel free to send me an email.</p>
